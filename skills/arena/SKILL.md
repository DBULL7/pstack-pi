# Arena

Open a todolist with one entry per phase (Frame, Fan out, Cross-judge, Pick, Graft, Verify) before launching anything.

## Phase A: Frame

Every candidate gets the same prompt, so the prompt is the contract.

1. State the artifact each candidate is producing.
2. Derive the rubric. State what success looks like for *this* task, then turn it into 3-6 concrete gradeable criteria. The rubric is the picker's tool in Phase D. Candidates only see the task.
3. Pick the runners from the named agents exposed by Pi's `subagent` tool. Prefer different configured model families for judgment-sensitive work. Use the same agent N times only when the work is generation-bound. If fewer suitable routes exist, shrink N and report the diversity limitation.
4. Assign output paths. Each candidate writes to its own location (a git worktree where possible, otherwise `/tmp/arena-<slug>/candidate-<n>/`), per the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill.

## Phase B: Fan out

Use one Pi `subagent` call with `tasks: [...]`, each containing the agent name, task, path to shared grounding, its own output path, and instructions to produce both the artifact and a short rationale. The call collects all terminal results. For work that must truly finish later, use `bg_delegate` only when read-only capability is sufficient.

If a candidate produces no output, proceed with N-1 and note the dropout.

## Phase C: Cross-judge

After all Phase B candidates complete, choose a configured read-only planner or reviewer agent, preferably on a different model family from the parent and runners. Use Pi's `subagent` tool to run one judge. It sees the rubric and candidates by path label, scores each criterion, and recommends a base with rationale. Run it only after candidates finish; otherwise it can see partial output.

## Phase D: Pick a base

Read every candidate end to end before picking. Score each against the rubric criterion by criterion, not on holistic feel, and compare with the cross-judge. Agreement on the base confirms the pick. Disagreement means one of you is biased or the rubric was ambiguous. Read both rationales before deciding.

Pick the base a future maintainer can extend most easily without breaking invariants. When two feel tied, prefer the cleaner boundary or smaller API, per the Laziness Protocol.

## Phase E: Graft

Walk each losing candidate once more for what is worth porting into the base, usually one or two things per candidate, not most of it. Fold each graft in by hand, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** principle skill, so the result stays coherent under one mental model. Don't paste mechanically.

If the candidates converge on one shape, that is strong agreement. Note it and ship the consensus shape. No graft is needed. If they wildly diverge, Phase A was under-specified. Reframe and re-run rather than averaging the divergence.

## Phase F: Verify

Verify the synthesized artifact like any other output, per the **prove-it-works** principle skill. If verification finds a problem the arena missed, either Phase A was wrong (re-frame and re-run) or a candidate caught it and you missed the graft (go back to Phase E). Don't paper over it.

## Outputs

One synthesized artifact, with a short synthesis note alongside naming the base and why, the cross-judge's verdict, each graft with its source candidate, what was rejected and why, any convergence or dropouts, and the verification result.
